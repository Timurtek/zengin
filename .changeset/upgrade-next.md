`zengin upgrade`: every owned file's pragma now carries the hash of what was copied, so the command can tell a local edit from an upstream change. A report lists each file as current, upstream, local, conflict or unknown, with a diff for conflicts; `--write` takes upstream changes the project did not touch and moves the pinned version, `--force` takes upstream over a conflict. Stylesheets of components carry the pragma too; stories never do.

`zengin create --framework next`: the App Router under `src/app` with the template's head and styles in `layout.tsx` and its `App` mounted client-side from `page.tsx`; `theme`, `fonts` and `brand` patch the layout's head as they patch `index.html`.
