# @zenginui/adapter-css

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`68deff9`](https://github.com/Timurtek/zengin/commit/68deff932336bf06a8c9d92655fd53683a9abceb) Thanks [@Timurtek](https://github.com/Timurtek)! - Two ways a system adapts without drifting.
  
  `zengin define` teaches the manifest about the components a project writes itself. A component under an
  ownership path had the contract and substitution rules switched off for its own file, which left the rest of
  the project unable to be held to it: a misspelled prop or an invented variant on your own component passed.
  The command reads the props from the component's TypeScript types, the defaults from its own destructuring,
  `extends` from the element whose attributes pass through, and `owns` from its stylesheet, attributing a
  property to the prop whose data attribute governs it. It exports the component from the system's barrel at the
  same time, because a definition nobody can import changes nothing. The merge never removes: a prop the source
  cannot see survives, a hand-declared enum beats a type the walker could not open, and a disagreement about who
  controls a property is reported rather than resolved.
  
  `surfaces` in the config declare that part of a project is a different design on purpose. A marketing page and
  an application are not the same design, and the only previous ways to say so were two systems or a suppression,
  which both spell a deliberate difference as drift. A surface may layer token values and change a component's
  props, `owns` and `className` policy; it may not add or remove components. Each file is checked against the
  first surface whose `include` matches it, so `shape="pill"` is correct on marketing and still a violation in the
  application, and the inventory records which surface checked each file.

### Minor Changes

- [`52e16ea`](https://github.com/Timurtek/zengin/commit/52e16eac6c656a7f19ba72f1ed9bf21e46435542) Thanks [@Timurtek](https://github.com/Timurtek)! - `@zenginui/adapter-css` and `zengin init --from package <name>`: definitions from an installed design-system package. Tokens from its stylesheet with the variable names kept (`$extensions.zengin.cssVar`), a component manifest from its `.d.ts` (props, `tailwind-variants` enums, `extends` from `HTMLAttributes`, `passthrough` for types declared elsewhere), `classes.css` pointed at its precompiled utilities, and project theme stylesheets as foundations. Verified on umami-software/umami: 147 violations, 0 false positives.
  
  Engine: `classes.css` stylesheets are indexed as `external` class resolutions; `$extensions.zengin.cssVar` sets a token's variable name; manifests may declare `passthrough`, which turns `unknown-prop` off for that component with the reason on record; a nearest spacing fix is offered only when the neighbour is within 4px or half the value; fully transparent hex and rgba values are not color literals.
  
  Zengin UI: a `border.width` token (`--border-width`) and a `color.outline` token (`--color-outline`, transparent by default) that every component border uses, so a theme can thicken and darken every rule at once. New `brutal` theme: neo-brutalism, 2px black borders, hard offset shadows, square corners, yellow primary with black text, Archivo Black headlines.

- [`bf6477b`](https://github.com/Timurtek/zengin/commit/bf6477bd04edbd3fc4fdc317bf93d9adb941a09a) Thanks [@Timurtek](https://github.com/Timurtek)! - The npm scope is `@zenginui`: `@zenginui/ui`, `@zenginui/cli`, `@zenginui/engine` and the rest, since the `zengin` org was taken. The unscoped `zenginui` package carries the `zengin` bin, so `npm create zengin@latest my-app` is the install command. Generated projects, the registry's import rewriting, the docs and the rollup history all use the new scope.
